# Open Source Project — Group Discussion & Voting (First 30 Minutes)

## Purpose
Today, we’ll kick off a collaborative open source project for the whole class. The first 30 minutes will be spent in small groups brainstorming, sharing, and voting on project ideas.

---

## Step 1: Group Brainstorm (15 min)
- Break into groups of 3–5 students.
- Each group discusses:
  - What kinds of open source projects excite you?
  - What skills do you want to practice or learn?
  - What problems could we solve for CSI, the CS department, or the wider community?
- Each student writes down at least one project idea (can be a feature, tool, website, app, etc.).
- Groups consolidate their ideas and pick their top 2–3 to share.

---

## Step 2: Share & Record (10 min)
- Each group presents their top ideas to the class (brief, 1–2 minutes per group).
- Instructor or a designated note-taker records all ideas on the board or a shared doc.
- Clarify any ideas as needed so everyone understands the options.

---

## Step 3: Voting (5 min)
- Each student gets 2 votes (can’t vote twice for the same idea).
- Voting options:
  - Physical: Write your choices on a slip of paper and submit.
  - Digital: Use a Google Form, Poll Everywhere, or similar tool for anonymous voting.
- Instructor tallies votes and announces the winning project.
- If there’s a tie, a quick runoff vote will be held between the top ideas.

---

## Fairness & Participation
- Every student must submit at least one idea and cast two votes.
- Voting is anonymous to ensure fairness.
- The winning project will be a true class collaboration, with roles and contributions for everyone.

---

## After Voting
- Briefly discuss next steps: project setup, repo creation, and how to organize work.
- Assign initial roles or tasks for the next class.
